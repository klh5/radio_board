# radio_board

This board was made so that I could practice using Eagle, and also get some practice soldering SMD components. It consists of an ATMEGA328 and an RFM69 radio. The design is based on the Moteino (http://lowpowerlab.com/moteino/) with an added reset button and pads for an SMA connector for the antenna. You tend to get better range using just a wire antenna but they aren't very robust.

I have soldered one of these and it does work, though as the footprint is much bigger than a Moteino or Anarduino it is really only useful as practice, or as a basis for other designs.
